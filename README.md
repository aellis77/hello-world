# hello-world
first program.
Same name put this program's file repo in bitbucket rather than here.
Created a new repo hello-hello-world that has my real hello-world project.

Not so sure 'hello world' is right. Does a literary masterpiece have export control?

Personally, I'm not so certain I want to say hello to the world. Think of the possible import/export considerations.
